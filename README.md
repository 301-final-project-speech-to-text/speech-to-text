# Code 301 Final Project: Goya
Final Project Repo

## Version
1.0.0 

## Project title
Goya - Live your story

The name Goya comes from the Urdu language. It refers to the suspension of disbelief that happens when fantasy is so realistic that it temporarily becomes reality. It's commonly associated with powerful storytelling and is included in the world's 20 most beautiful, untranslateable words. 

## Problem Domain
Our concept is to break through the language barriers for travelers and those living in a place where they are new to the common tongue. The app allows the user to communicate with any language currently supported by Google's Translate API.

## Build status
### Planning phase

#### User Stories
User stories describe the features of an application based on the target audience. Each user story should map directly to a feature and should focus on who makes up the target audience, what they will gain from the feature, and why this feature is being included in the application. The application should focus on the targeted audience so you know who you are building it for and why someone would use it. User stories also help identify gaps in the planning process.
"As a ____, I want ____ so that ____."

#### Wireframes
Each page or view of your application should have its own wireframe and some pages may have multiple wireframes to illustrate changes based on user interaction.

#### Conflict Plan

#### Communication Plan

#### Project Scope
 - MVP
 - Stretch

### Project Organization
 - Kanban board on Trello

#### Daily Team Workflow
Day 1: Pitch the idea to your instructor. Once the idea is approved, create your repository, fill your project board with issues, and begin scaffolding your files. Deploy your site, then begin to build features.

Day 2: This should be a big build-out day of features.

Day 3: Continue to build out features. Strive for full MVP by the end of the day.

Day 4: Work on any additional styling and refactoring. Work on some stretch goals. Practice your presentation.

Day 5: Presentation Day!
